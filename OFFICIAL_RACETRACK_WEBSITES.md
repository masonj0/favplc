## ⚠️ Caveats

- **URLs shift constantly** — tracks rebrand, get acquired, or move to parent-company domains. Always verify.
- **Some tracks have closed since my training data** — Arlington Park (IL), Golden Gate Fields (CA), Portland Meadows (OR), Suffolk Downs (MA) are among notable closures. I tried to exclude known closures but some may have slipped through.
- **Depth of data varies wildly** — HKJC and JRA publish sectional times, pool sizes, and dividends; some smaller US tracks only post basic results.
- **Harness sites** are generally less polished than thoroughbred sites. USTA's ustrotting.com and Woodbine's portal tend to be the best harness data sources.
